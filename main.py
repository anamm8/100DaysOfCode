# Day 1 - Print

#Printing strings !Attention to use exactly the predefined keywords. Print("a") won't work!
print("Hello World")
print("this will appear on a new line")
print("yet another line")

#Printing exactly as I want
print("""
          This is
                  an
      experiment
""")

# Input
# very similar to the print command, except that it'll show the message in the console then wait until the user has typed something into the console and pressed enter
input("Input >")
